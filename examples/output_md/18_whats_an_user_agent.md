### Question
What\'s an (user) agent?


### Answer
User agents (or just agents) are client programs that make HTTP requests
on the user's behalf. Any application that issues web requests is an
HTTP agent. So far, we've talked about only one kind of HTTP agent: web
browsers. But there are many other kinds of user agents.
