### Question
What\'s a web cache?


### Answer
A web cache or caching proxy is a special type of HTTP proxy server that
keeps cop-ies of popular documents that pass through the proxy. The next
client requesting the same document can be served from the cache's
personal copy.\
\
A client may be able to download a document much more quickly from a
nearby cache than from a distant web server. HTTP defines many
facilities to make caching more effective and to regulate the freshness
and privacy of cached content.
