### Question
What is a proxy?


### Answer
A proxy sits between a client and a server, receiving all of the
client's HTTP requests and relaying the requests to the server (perhaps
after modifying the requests). These applications act as a proxy for the
user, accessing the server on the user's behalf.\
\
Proxies are often used for security, acting as trusted intermediaries
through which all web traffic flows. Proxies can also filter requests
and responses; for example, to detect application viruses in corporate
downloads or to filter adult content away from elementary-school
students.
