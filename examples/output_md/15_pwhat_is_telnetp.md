### Question
What is Telnet?


### Answer
The Telnet utility connects your keyboard to a destination TCP port and
connects the TCP port output back to your display screen. Telnet is
commonly used for remote terminal sessions, but it can generally connect
to any TCP server, including HTTP servers.\
\
You can use the Telnet utility to talk directly to web servers. Telnet
lets you open a TCP connection to a port on a machine and type
characters directly into the port.\
The web server treats you as a web client, and any data sent back on the
TCP con-nection is displayed onscreen.
