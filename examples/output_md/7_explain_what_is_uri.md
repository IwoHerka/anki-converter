### Question
Explain what is URI.


### Answer
Each web server resource has a name, so clients can point out what
resources they are interested in. The server resource name is called a
uniform resource identifier, or URI. URIs are like the postal addresses
of the Internet, uniquely identifying and locating information resources
around the world.\
