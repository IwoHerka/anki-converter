### Question
What is `Kernel` module?


### Answer
`Kernel` is Elixir\'s default environment.\
It mainly consists of:\

-   basic language primitives, such as arithmetic operators, spawning of
    processes, data type handling, and others
-   macros for control-flow and defining new functionality (modules,
    functions, and the like)
-   guard checks for augmenting pattern matching
