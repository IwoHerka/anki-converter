### Question
What is a supervisor and supervision tree?


### Answer
A supervisor is a process which supervises other processes, which we
refer to as child processes. Supervisors are used to build a
hierarchical process structure called a supervision tree. Supervision
trees provide fault-tolerance and encapsulate how our applications start
and shutdown.
