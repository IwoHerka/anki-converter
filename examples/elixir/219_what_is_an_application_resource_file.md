It\'s a plain-text file written in Erlang terms that describes the
application. Applications are specified in their *resource file*, which
is a file called APP.app, where APP is the application name. For
example, the application resource file of the OTP application ex\_unit
is called ex\_unit.app.

You\'ll find the resource file of an application in its **ebin**
directory, it is generated automatically by Mix. Some of its keys are
taken from the keyword lists returned by the project/0 and application/0
functions defined in mix.exs, and others are generated by Mix itself.\
