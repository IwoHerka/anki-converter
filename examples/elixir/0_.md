### Question

What is the output of the following code?

```elixir
spawn(fn ->
  spawn_link(fn ->
    Process.sleep(1000)
    IO.puts("Process 2 finished")
  end)
  raise("Something went wrong in Process 1")
end)
```

### Answer
Something like:
```
#PID<0.140.0> 15:00:40.443 [error] Process #PID<0.140.0> raised an exception **
(RuntimeError) Something went wrong in Process 1 (stdlib) erl_eval.erl:678: :erl_eval.do_apply/6
```

`spawn_link/1` connects exactly two processes and is always
bidirectional. Even though process 2 is sleeping, because process 1
terminated abnormally, which caused an exit signal emitted to process 2;
As a result process 2 exits as well.
