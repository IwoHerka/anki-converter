\
is defined as below: It expects a module, **{module, arg}** or **a map**
as the child specification. If a module is given, the specification is
retrieved by calling **module.child\_spec(arg)**.

<div>

After the child specification is retrieved, the fields on overrides are
directly applied on the child spec. If overrides has keys that do not
map to any child specification field, an error is raised.

Think of a scenario where this call might be useful?

### Answer
Scenario where a supervisor needs to start multiple workers of the same
GenServer. Here\'s snippet from a Supervisor code:

<div>

| ::: {.highlight style="background: #f8f8f8"}                          |
| ``` {style="line-height: 125%"}                                       |
| def start_link(_) do   File.mkdir_p!(@db_folder)   c                  |
| hildren= Enum.map(1..@pool_size, &worker_spec/1)   Supervisor.start_l |
| ink(children, strategy: :one_for_one) end  defp worker_spec(worker_id |
| ) do   default_worker_spec={Todo.DatabaseWorker, {@db_folder, worker_ |
| id}}   Supervisor.child_spec(default_worker_spec, id: worker_id) end  |
| ```                                                                   |
| :::                                                                   |

You start off by creating a list of three child specifications, each of
them describing one database worker. Then you pass this list to
Supervisor.start\_link/2. The specification for each worker is created
in worker\_spec/1. You start off with the default specification for the
database worker, {Todo.DatabaseWorker, {\@db\_folder, worker\_id}}. Then
you use **Supervisor.child\_spec/2 to set the unique ID for the
worker**. Without that, you'd end up with multiple children having the
same ID. Recall that **a default child\_spec/1, generated via use
GenServer**, provides the name of the module in the :id field.
Consequently, if you use that default specification and try to start two
database workers, they'll both get the same ID of Todo.DatabaseWorker.
The Supervisor module will complain about it and raise an error.Â
