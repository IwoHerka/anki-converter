An OTP application is a **runtime** **construct**: a resource file
that's dynamically interpreted by the corresponding OTP-specific code.
When using mix, you describe some aspects of this file, and other
aspects are derived from your code. But the application itself has
meaning only at runtime.

In contrast, a mix project is a **compile-time construct**. In the
mix.exs file, you describe your application and implement modules. The
compilation process then produces an application resource file.Â
